# Linux File Explorer Application

A console-based File Explorer written in C++ for Linux systems.  
This project provides a complete file management system that supports navigation, file manipulation, search, and permission management directly through the terminal.

## Project Overview

**Project Type:** Capstone Project  
**Language Used:** C++  
**Operating System:** Linux 
**Development Time:** 5 Days  
---
## Features Overview

### Day 1: Basic Operations
- List files in the current directory (simple and detailed view)
- Display file permissions, size, owner, group, and modification time
- Color-coded display for directories, executables, and regular files

### Day 2: Navigation
- Change directories (absolute and relative paths)
- Navigate to the parent directory
- Display the current working directory
- Real-time path tracking

### Day 3: File Manipulation
- Create files and directories
- Delete files and directories (with recursive option)
- Copy files and directories recursively
- Move files or directories (supports cross-filesystem operations)
- Rename files or directories

### Day 4: Search Functionality
- Recursive file search across directories
- Case-insensitive search
- Display full file paths for all search results

### Day 5: Permission Management
- View file permissions in symbolic and octal format
- Change permissions using the `chmod` command
- Change ownership and group using the `chown` command
- Display owner, group, size, and last modification time

---

## Prerequisites

- Linux environment (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, or WSL)
- Installed `g++` compiler
- Installed `make` utility
- Root or sudo privileges (for permission and ownership operations)

---

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

## User Interface Highlights

* Clear and structured menu layout
* Color-coded file output
* Real-time directory updates
* Informative feedback messages
* Safe user confirmations before delete operation
---

### System Calls Used

* `opendir()`, `readdir()`, `closedir()` – Directory operations
* `stat()` – Retrieve file metadata
* `mkdir()`, `rmdir()`, `unlink()` – File and directory creation/deletion
* `rename()` – Move or rename files
* `chmod()` – Change permissions
* `chown()` – Change ownership
* `getcwd()`, `chdir()` – Directory management

### Permission Representation

| Format   | Example    |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Symbolic | drwxr-xr-x |
| Octal    | 755        |

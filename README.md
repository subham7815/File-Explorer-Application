## 📝 Technical Details

### System Calls Used
- `opendir()`, `readdir()`, `closedir()` - Directory operations
- `stat()` - File information retrieval
- `mkdir()` - Directory creation
- `rmdir()`, `unlink()` - Deletion operations
- `rename()` - Move/rename operations
- `chmod()` - Permission modification
- `chown()` - Ownership modification
- `getcwd()`, `chdir()` - Directory navigation

### File Permission Format
Permissions are displayed in both symbolic and octal formats:
- **Symbolic:** `drwxr-xr-x` (d=directory, r=read, w=write, x=execute)
- **Octal:** `755` (7=rwx, 5=r-x, 5=r-x)

### Permission Breakdown
```
Owner  Group  Others
rwx    r-x    r-x
421    421    421
 7      5      5
```

## 🔐 Permissions Required

### Standard Operations
- Reading, listing, searching: User read permissions
- Creating, copying files: User write permissions
- Executing, navigating: User execute permissions

### Administrative Operations (require sudo)
- Changing ownership with `chown`
- Modifying permissions on system files
- Accessing restricted directories

## 🐛 Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid directory paths
- Permission denied errors
- File not found errors
- Invalid input validation
- Directory deletion of non-empty directories

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Recursive Search
The search function recursively traverses all subdirectories to find matching files.

### Smart File Sizing
File sizes are automatically formatted with appropriate units (B, KB, MB, GB, TB).

### Safety Confirmations
Destructive operations (like deletion) require user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.

### Cross-Platform Path Handling
Supports both absolute (`/home/user/file`) and relative (`../folder/file`) paths.

4. **C++ Programming** - Object-oriented design, STL usage, and modern C++ features
5. **User Interface Design** - Creating intuitive console-based interfaces
6. **Error Handling** - Robust error checking and user feedback

## 🤝 Day-wise Implementation Guide

### Day 1: Foundation (✅ Complete)
- Application architecture design
- Basic file listing functionality
- Color-coded output system

### Day 2: Navigation (✅ Complete)

- Path handling (absolute/relative)
- Current directory tracking

### Day 3: Manipulation (✅ Complete)
- File creation and deletion
- Directory operations
- Copy and move functionality

### Day 4: Search (✅ Complete)

- User/group information display

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Root Privileges:** Some operations (like changing ownership or accessing system directories) may require root privileges. Run with `sudo` when necessary.

2. **Empty Directories Only:** The delete operation only works on empty directories. To delete non-empty directories, implement recursive deletion (use with caution).

3. **File Overwriting:** Copy operations will overwrite existing files without warning. Add checks if needed.

4. **Symbolic Links:** The application handles symbolic links but displays them as regular files in simple mode.

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Recursive directory deletion
- File preview/viewing
- Archive operations (zip/tar)
- File filtering and sorting options
- Bookmark favorite directories
- Command history
- Batch operations
- File comparison tool
